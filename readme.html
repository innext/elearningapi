About this work
<br>
This is the API for the test Elearning site am working on. This site is to show my learning of Backend with JavaScript i.e Node.JS. To the best of my learning I am building to have an Industry standard working API that I would be consuming with JavaScript framework.
<br>
The framework and package I will/am using include MongoDB, Express, Mongoose
<br>
Installation
<br>
Installing is done with the npm install command but before that you must have node installed, to check use
<br>
$ node -v
$ npm -v
<br>
this would give you the version of the node you have installed and that of its package manager
<br>
Usage
<br>
$ npm install
$ node app.js
