## About this work

This is the API for the test Elearning site am working on. This site is to show my learning of Backend with JavaScript i.e [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org). To the best of my learning I am building to have an Industry standard working API that I would be consuming with JavaScript framework.

I will/am using [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com), [Express](https://expressjs.com), [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com), [Bcrypt]()

## Installation

Installing is done with the [`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locall) but before that you must have node installed, to check use
```bash
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```
this would give you the version of the node you have installed and that of its package manager

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```

## Futher Explaination

The routes above is used to simplify the routes available and not all user have all the routes :). 

The `{{baseURL}}` changes depending on the role of the user of this API. Here are what the `{{baseURL}}` is for normal user `localhost:2020`, for tutor `localhost:2020/tutor/`, for admin `localhost:2020/admin/` and for custom service `localhost:2020/cs/`.

## Version 1.0

The version 1.0 is mainly to test all endpoint to see they carryout what they should. In this version we have four roles and they are admin with the route `{{adminURL}} or localhost:2020/admin,` the customer services with `{{csURL}} or localhost:2020/cs,` the tutor with `{{tutorURL}} or localhost:2020/tutor` and the user or student with `{{userURL}} or localhost:2020/.`

Since version 1.0 is for testing endpoints only, `no authentication nor authorization` is put in place yet. The [ElearningAPI.postman_collection.json](`./ElearningAPI.postman_collection.json`) would be of help in testing this version.

This are still under development to meet up with up with the version 1.0
* During update, the object with values should not be over-written by null
* Validator to stop picking the previous data + incoming data for validation
* Login route
* Check answer
